U Wot M8 is just text slang for ' You what mate?' - a confrontational phrase used mainly in Northern England. Normally in response to another confrontational phrase - see example below. It does make sense though is abbreviated, it is a shortened of "YOU are going to do WHAT, MATE?" Mate being the obvious indicator that there is trouble afoot. This abbreviation is probably the cause of much confusion to the American audience since they have similar difficulty with 'half two' meaning half past two (not one or one thirty like some of the common guesses).

"I am going to twat you."  
"U Wot M8?"

"I did your Mum last night!"  
"You what mate?"
